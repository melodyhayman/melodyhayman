# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Melody Hayman**. I am a Ph.D. student at Colorado State University in the Cell and Molecular Biology program. I got my B.S. in Neuroscience with a minor in Chemistry from Mercer University and my M.S. in Biochemistry and molecular biology from Clemson University. 
I currently work under the guidance of Dr. Lucas Argueso studying the genetic mechanism of meiotic _de novo_ recurrent copy number variations via the pathway of non allelic homologous recombination for double stranded DNA break repair using budding yeast as our model organism. 
I have a passion for all biochemical research with a special interest in precision medicine and gene therapy.
